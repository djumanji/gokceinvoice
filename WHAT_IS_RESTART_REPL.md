## ⚠️ Before vs After

### Before Restart:
- App is running
- Shows logs in console
- Your URL is accessible
- Environment variables loaded

### After Stop:
- Console shows "No process running"
- All stopped
- URL not accessible

### After Run:
- Fresh start
- New logs appear
- Environment variables reload
- Clean slate

---

## 💡 Why Restart?

### 1. **Load New Environment Variables**
If you changed `DATABASE_URL` or `SESSION_SECRET` in Secrets → they're not loaded until restart

### 2. **Pick Up New Code**
After pushing to GitHub → Replit needs to restart to load new code

### 3. **Database Changes**
After running migrations → restart to reconnect to database

### 4. **Fix Weird Issues**
Sometimes the app gets "stuck" → restart clears it

---

## 🔍 How to Know If You Need to Restart

**Look at your console output:**
- If you see new code changes mentioned
- If environment variables changed
- If database was updated
- If something feels "off"

**When in doubt, restart!** ✅

---

## 🆚 Restart vs Reset

| Action | What It Does | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Restart (Stop → Run)** | Restarts your app | Daily use, after changes |
| **Reset Repl** | Deletes everything! | Never (unless disaster) |

⚠️ **Never click "Reset" unless you want to lose all data!**

---

## ✅ Quick Checklist

After these actions, **always restart:**

- [ ] Changed Secrets (environment variables)
- [ ] Ran database migrations
- [ ] Pushed new code to GitHub
- [ ] Changed configuration files
- [ ] Database connection issues

---

## 🎬 Step-by-Step Example

**Scenario:** You just updated `DATABASE_URL` in Secrets

1. **Go to your Replit tab**
2. **Look at top bar** → See `🟢 Run ⏸️ Pause ⏹️ Stop`
3. **Click** the **⏹️ Stop** button
4. **Wait** until console shows "No process running"
5. **Click** the **▶️ Run** button
6. **Watch** new logs appear
7. **See** "Initializing PostgreSQL storage..." message
8. **Done!** ✅

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

❌ **Just refreshing the page**  
✅ Click the Stop/Run buttons

❌ **Expecting immediate changes**  
✅ Always restart after changing Secrets

❌ **Forgetting to stop first**  
✅ Always Stop → Wait → Run

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Watch the console** - It shows when restart starts/finishes
2. **Check logs** - See if environment loaded correctly
3. **Test immediately** - Try your app right after restart
4. **Bookmark URL** - So you can test quickly

---

## 🎉 That's It!

**Restart = Stop then Run**  
**That simple!** 😊

Restart your Repl now to apply the DATABASE_URL changes.
