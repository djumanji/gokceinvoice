# 🎫 Invoice Creation Button Fix

## ✅ Status: **Fixed**

The "Save as Draft" and "Mark as Sent" buttons in invoice creation now work correctly!

---

## 🐛 Problem

The buttons were calling the handler directly without:
1. Triggering form validation
2. Showing loading states
3. Providing error feedback

## 🔧 Solution

### 1. **Added Form Validation**
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (status: "draft" | "sent") => {
  // For "sent" status, require validation
  if (status === "sent") {
    const isValid = await form.trigger();
    if (!isValid) {
      return;
    }
  }
  
  const data = { ...form.getValues(), lineItems, taxRate };
  onSubmit(data, status);
};
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ "Save as Draft" - bypasses validation (allows incomplete invoices)
- ✅ "Mark as Sent" - requires validation (ensures complete data)

### 2. **Added Loading States**
- Buttons now show "Saving..." when submitting
- Buttons are disabled during submission
- Prevents double-clicks and duplicate invoices

### 3. **Added Error Handling**
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Clear error messages shown to users
- Console logging for debugging

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Save as Draft Button:
1. Click button
2. Collects form data (validation optional)
3. Sends to API with `status: "draft"`
4. Shows loading state
5. Success toast + redirect to invoices list
6. Error handling if fails

### Mark as Sent Button:
1. Click button
2. **Validates all required fields**
3. Shows validation errors if invalid
4. If valid, sends to API with `status: "sent"`
5. Shows loading state
6. Success toast + redirect to invoices list
7. Error handling if fails

## ✅ Testing

**To test the fix:**

1. **Restart your Repl** to load latest code
2. **Create an invoice:**
   - Fill in some fields (not all)
   - Click "Save as Draft" ✅ Should work
   - Fill in required fields
   - Click "Mark as Sent" ✅ Should work
3. **Check for:**
   - Loading states on buttons
   - Success/error toast messages
   - Form validation on "Mark as Sent"
   - Redirect to invoices list on success
