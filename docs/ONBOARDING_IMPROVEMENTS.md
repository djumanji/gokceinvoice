# Onboarding Improvements

## Summary

Enhanced the onboarding experience with visual feedback and automatic completion tracking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Visual Feedback with Bright Green Checkmarks
- ✅ Completed tasks now show a bright green checkmark with green background
- ✅ Incomplete tasks show a gray circle border
- ✅ Green color: `bg-green-500` with `border-green-600`
- ✅ White checkmark icon for better contrast

### 2. Profile Completion Check
- Added profile completion check to onboarding logic
- Profile is considered complete when user has set:
  - Company name OR
  - Address OR
  - Phone OR
  - Tax Office ID

### 3. Enhanced Onboarding Completion Logic

**Before:** Only checked for clients, invoices, and services

**After:** Now checks for:
1. Profile is set (company name, address, phone, or tax ID)
2. At least 1 client created
3. At least 1 service created
4. At least 1 invoice created

### 4. Automatic Banner Hiding
- Onboarding banner (`OnboardingProgressBanner`) automatically hides when all steps are complete
- No need for manual dismissal
